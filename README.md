# dotfiles
My Dotfiles. Picked up here and there to get the most enjoyable experience.
Works for me.

## Vim + tmux + fish
* Vim configuration is mostly based on [dotvim](https://github.com/bling/dotvim).
* Ideavim configuration to emulate my vim worklow with PyCharm (pycharm
refactorings works better for me than rope).
* Seemless navigation with combo vim/tmux.
* Fish as default shell for tmux.
* Solarize(d) everything! (fish, guake, tmux, vim)
* xmodmap to remap caps-lock and esc keys.
* Installation and lyncing with dotvim. It's assumed that your dotfiles
located in ~/dotfiles. On Windows plain old bat.
