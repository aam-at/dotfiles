! use xev to get keycodes
! use xmodmap without arguments to see modifiers
! modifiers are shift, control, lock, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5
! mod1 - mod5 are for free use
! XCompose intercepts sequences of typed characters and replaces them with 
! other sequences; i.e., a dead key followed by another key produces a new
! character

! format of keycode/keysym lines:
! [keycode|keysym] [<keycode|keysym>] = <1> <2> <3> <4>
! where <1> <key>, <2> <shift-key>, <3> <Mode_switch-key>
! <4> <shift-Mode_switch-key>
clear Mod2
clear Mod3
clear Mod4
clear Mod5

! Swap caps lock and escape
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock

! make hold enter be right control
! see: http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/11/12/a-crazy-productivity-boost-remap-return-to-control/
! remove Control = Control_R
! keycode 0x69 = Return
! keycode 0x24 = Control_R
! add Control = Control_R

! Make the "Windows" Key Mode_Switch
! keycode 133 on my lapptop
! (for non-latin chars below) and Mod4
keycode 133 = Mode_switch
